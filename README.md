# AIML-Project

## Project Title
- "Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using AI."

## Project Overview
-There are numerous potential use cases for ML in telecommunications networks . In the area of
system monitoring, anomaly detection systems are crucial for identifying performance issues and
problematic network behavior.
- Predicting whether a consumer will switch from one organisation to another is the major goal of this project.


## Problem Statement
-  predicting customer churn in the telecom industry.

## Objectives
- List the specific objectives:
  - Developing a predictive model for identifying potential churners.
  - Implementing AI-powered predictive analysis to optimize network performance.
  - Reducing churn rates and business losses in the telecom industry.

## Dataset
- Telecom-Customer-Churn
- source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data

## Methodology
- Explain the methodology you used to tackle the problem, including:
  - Data preprocessing steps.
  - Feature selection or engineering techniques.
  - Machine learning algorithms or AI models used for churn prediction.

## Results
- Hyper parameter adjustment increases the decision tree model performance by 8%.
- can quickly identify outliers via visualisation Analysing exploratory data

## Implementation
- We use the fundamental Python libraries numpy, pandas, and sklearn to implement, and we also need to import seaborn and matplotlib to visualise.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential future enhancements or directions for your project, such as:
  - Incorporating real-time data for more accurate predictions.
  - Expanding the scope to address other telecom industry challenges.
  
## Conclusion
- The goal of this program is to see how well various statistical methods perform in predicting satisfaction of
customers based on the characteristics of the age, gender, flight distance, class, wi-fi services etc.
- Reiterate the significance of reducing customer churn in the telecom industry.
